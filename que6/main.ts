//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
// Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, 
//so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
